# hello-world
My first git repository :)

Hello everyone!
I am currently a student at Politecnico di Milano, working on my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. Although this is the case, I find myself more interested in mathematical/computational engineering. I like to code numerical methods and run simulations.

I am also interested in the arts. Being in Italy makes me appreciate all the old and new art styles. I love learning about the history and the stories behind the people who created these works of art. 

I play the trumpet, piano, and the guitar. I can dabble in the french horn and the saxophone. Jazz and the blues are a big passions of mine; but, I do not limit myself to these genres. I enjoy my fair share of rock, EDM, romanian disco, classical, reggaeton, etc

I hope that I can learn from the open-source commutinuity how to further spread knowledge and help each other out :)
